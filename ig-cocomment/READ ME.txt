REQUIREMENTS:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) WordPress v1.5 or above(tested with v1.5.2 and v2.x)
2) You need to be a top-level administrator to enable & configure
   the plugin.


INSTALLATION:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Drop the ig_cocomment.php file into your plugins folder.
2) Open the plugin management page in your WP-Admin.
3) Locate the iG:CoComment entry & activate.

That's all, coComment will now be integrated in your WordPress theme.
The plugin requires your WordPress theme to have the "comment_form" hook.
All well-formed themes have this hook.


CONFIGURATION:-
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Navigate to the OPTIONS tab in your wp-admin and you'll see a tab
in the sub nav-bar for this plugin. Open it & you'll see 2 options
there, "Auto Activate coComment" & "Allow coComment to Track all Comments".
You need to remember that only 1 of these options can be enabled. You
can't have both of them enabled. If you enable both of them, then in that
case the "Allow coComment to Track all Comments" option will take precedence
and will be enabled, which will mean that regardless of current state, the
other option will be disabled.

However, you can disable both of these options, the plugin will still be
functional, as its main aim is to integrate coComment and allow it to receive
comments data from your blog easily. Its just that if you disable both options
then the users of coComment will have to click on their coComment bookmarklet
to activate coComment each time they want their comment to be tracked by
coComment. In that case, coComment will track comments made by its users only
& won't be tracking all subsequent comments.

"Auto Activate coComment" when enabled, will activate coComment for the users
logged into coComment service at that time. It saves them the trouble of
clicking their coComment bookmarklet each time.

"Allow coComment to Track all Comments" when enabled, will not only activate
coComment for the users logged into coComment, but will also track all the
subsequent comments made after them, irrespective of whether the subsequent
commentators are coComment users or not. BY DEFAULT, THIS OPTION IS ENABLED.
YOU ARE ADVISED TO KEEP THIS AS IT IS.

If you don't want coComment enabled for your blog, then de-activate the
plugin. In that case, whether or not coComment is used on your blog depends
on coComment's support for WordPress(which is not fully supported yet). So
it might work for some users and it might not work for others.


If you want to track your comments then you will need to signup with
coComment as well. Its free & easy, go for it.

coComment is currently in a beta, sometimes there might occur some problems
with the service. That won't harm your blog in anyway though, but still if
it does, then you can't hold me liable for anything.
